# Chatroom-attempt
Attempt at creating a small online chatroom.

Node js is required to run this script from the commandline, which can be downloaded for windows here https://nodejs.org/en/download/. After placing the files into a single folder e.g. "Chatroom", navigate to the folder path through the commandline and type "npm install" to install the modules that the script depends on, followed by "node server.js" to begin using the script. Once the local server starts, open a browser and navigate to "localhost:" followed by the port number stated in the commandline (most likely 5000).
